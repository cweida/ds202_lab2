### Analysis of Rating Distribution
It appears as though the ratings are slightly skewed left. The majority of chocolates are rated at between 3 and 3.5.
It seems as though there is low correlation between cocoa percentage and rating. There are large numbers of samples with different cocoa percentages at all levels of ratings.
